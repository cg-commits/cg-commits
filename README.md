👋 Hi, I’m @cg-commits  
👀 I’m interested in building clean, thoughtful, and useful software – currently exploring the world of iOS development.  
🌱 I’m currently learning Swift, SwiftUI and Kotlin – starting from the fundamentals, one step at a time.  
💬 I like asking “why is it like that?” – especially when learning something new.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small but meaningful learning projects – clean code > clever code.  
📫 How to reach me: here for now – DM or issues are fine.  
😄 Pronouns: he/him  
⚡ Fun fact: My favorite operator in Swift is probably `??` – it’s basically a tiny safety net.
