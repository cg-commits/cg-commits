# Hi, I’m Chris 👋

Software developer with a background in product and sound design (former lead designer).

I design and build software where experience, usability, and clarity matter. Before moving into development, I spent several years as a lead UX/UI and sound designer, which still shapes how I approach code: I care about structure, feedback, and how a product feels in the hands of real users.

---

## About me

* Background in UX/UI and sound design for interactive media and digital products (automotive, pro audio, and tech)
* More than a decade working on creative and technical projects (from prototypes to production)
* Now focused on native development and modern UI frameworks

I’m particularly interested in tools that simplify complex workflows, products for creatives, and applications where sound and interaction design play a meaningful role.

---

## How I work

* I want to understand the problem and constraints before writing code.
* I like to explore ideas via small, focused prototypes.
* I appreciate clear communication, honest feedback, and shared ownership of the product.

## What I’m looking for

I’m open to:

* Collaborations on apps or tools for productivity, creativity, audio, or other design-centric products, ideally with an open-source focus
* Freelance or full-time roles that combine product thinking, UX, and hands-on development

If your team cares about thoughtful UX and clean, maintainable code, we’ll likely work well together.
